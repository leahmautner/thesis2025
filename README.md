# Project
2025 Masters' Thesis exploring unmet need in mental healthcare using 2022-2023 NSDUH data (N=5,493). Analyses investigate psychological distress as a predictor and race/ethnicity as a moderator of perceived cause of unmet need (cost, structural, minimization of problem, low perceived treatment effectiveness, stigma) among those who did not utilize mental health services in past year. 

# Methods
All analyses conducted using R Studio. Descriptive statistics included unweighted frequencies with percentages and weighted proportions with 95% CIs. Cross-tabulations and chi-square tests assessed unadjusted, weighted bivariable associations between covariates and each perceived barrier. Weighted multivariable analyses further investigated associations between severity, barriers, and covariates. Four quasibinomial logistic regression models were estimated for each barrier: (1) distress only, (2) distress + covariates, (3) distress + interaction term, (4) distress + interaction term + covariates. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) assessed discriminatory power and compared areas under the curve (AUC) to maximize model performance.

# Key Findings
Psychological distress remains the strongest predictor of perceived cause of unmet need. The most frequently reported barriers overall were structural and minimization of the problem. Psychological distress had the strongest associations with low perceived treatment effectiveness, followed by structural barriers and stigma-related concerns. While formal effect modification for race/ethnicity was not detected, stratified models revealed meaningful reporting differences between across groups. These findings suggest distress may not only influence how individuals think about care, but how effectively they are able to access it.
